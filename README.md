### Hi!

I'm a student from New York interested in game preservation and reverse engineering. GitHub is home to the vast majority of my work.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
  - [Soapbox Race World](https://github.com/SoapboxRaceWorld) - an emulator for an abandoned online multiplayer racing game.
  - [NFS Modding Tools](https://github.com/NFSTools) - content modification tools for the _Need for Speed_ game series.
  
ðŸ’¬ Ask me about **game modding and reverse engineering**.

âš¡ Fun fact: I was featured in [a PC Gamer article](https://www.pcgamer.com/how-players-resurrected-the-need-for-speed-mmo-you-didnt-even-know-existed/) about Soapbox Race World.
